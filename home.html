    <h2 class="homeT" >First The challenges</h2>
    <p class="homeT">&emsp;Its extremely hard. I wake up alone and then go to work and after work im back home alone. I miss sitting talking to him messaging him throughout the day. I miss feeling his touch and laughing with him and watching movies with him. There is not getting to see him every day. And for the jail that he is in we can not see each other in person at all it is just video visits but I will get into that later. There is finances all the way from putting money on books to paying to put time on the phone. The jail system seems to charge a lot for everything. It is a lot like having a long distance relationship. many people cannot handle long distance because they need physical touch and they cant be away from there person. As there are so many challenges if you truly love this person you would jump through fire for them and would not let this break you apart to. You just have to remember things like this will make your relationships much more stronger if you can wait. </p>

    <h2 class="homeT">Getting to Talk</h2>
    <p class="homeT">&emsp;Talking to him is very difficult. I can not just pick up the phone and call him. The only way to talk to him over the phone is to wait for him to call me. Some days I do not even get a call at all. Some days I am at work and extremely busy so I am not able to take the call. I however can download a jail messaging app to text him. This texting app costs 26 cents per message. Then there is visitation. some jails allow in-person visits but a lot of jails took that away during coronavirus and have not brought it back. It is extremely difficult to not be able to see the person that you are in love with in person. Yes its good you can video visit but so much goes wrong. 
    Some days the jail has issues with the internet and you miss it because they could not figure out how to get it to work. Other times I had it were the video never showed up and all that I could hear was audio. Also he was frozen one time and I waited a few minutes for it to fix but it did not so I had to close the visit and then reopen it just to see if it would fix the issue.

    <h2 class="homeT">The Waiting Game</h2>
    <p class="homeT">&emsp;He is going to be in there for a while. So I am currently just trying to keep my mind busy. Working more at work, working more on the house when im off. working out a lot more especially on days off. one problem I have is I like to eat my emotions so even when I work out more I am still gaining weight because of eating my emotions.
        However, I am also working on that and hoping to accomplish it very soon because I also have a weight loss goal that I would like to acheive before he gets out too. I know I can do this and our relationship will be unbreakable all I have to do is survive through the hardship. Things happen to make you stronger and I know this will make me stronger for sure.
