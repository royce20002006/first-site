        <h2 class="homeT">First The challenges</h2>
        <p class="homeT">&emsp;Its extremely hard having a boyfriend that is in jail. I never realized how hard it actually is until
            I started living it. You have to be all in to go through this. I miss him everyday and sometimes I don't even feel 
            like getting up and around. I have my ups and my downs. Some days I'm doing just fine and some days I feel like I cant
            even get myself up out of this empty bed that I am alone in. I know one day we will be back together but until that day comes
            I have to be strong. Most days I wake up alone and then go to work. After work i'm back home
            alone. I miss sitting talking to him messaging him throughout the day. I miss feeling his touch and laughing
            with him and watching movies with him. Not getting to see him everyday is a extremely hard struggle. The jail that he
            is in we can not see each other in person at all. The only way that we can see each other is through video visits.
            There is finances all the way from putting money on books to paying to put time on the phone. The jail
            system charges a lot for everything. It is a lot like having a long distance relationship. many
            people cannot handle long distance because they need physical touch and they can't be away from their person.
            I am one of those people I hate that I cannot touch him. It breaks my heart not being able to. I know that this 
            is just temporary but it is very hard not to be able to touch or kiss him. 
            There are so many challenges but if you truly love this person you would jump through fire for them and would
            not let this break you apart. You just have to remember things like this will make your relationships
            much more stronger if you can wait. </p>

        <h2 class="homeT">Getting to Talk</h2>
        <p class="homeT">&emsp;Talking to him is very difficult. I can not just pick up the phone and call him. The only
            way to talk to him over the phone is to wait for him to call me. Some days I do not even get a call at all.
            Some days I am at work and extremely busy so I am not able to take the call. When i do get to call him it is only
            a 15 minute call which is just not enough when you love the person. I hate that it is only 15 minutes and when I 
            get off the phone with him I get extremely depressed because I have no idea when the next time I will get to talk 
            to him. calls are 26 cents a minute and though you may think thats decent. Its actually not one 15 minute call is 
            almost 4 dollars. It's worth it to hear his voice.  I can download a jail
            messaging app to text him. However, he doesn't know when I text him until he actually checks his
            messages.  That means that I could have sent a message and never recieve one back until hours later. Its nice that I 
            can also send a video message or a picture if i want. This texting app costs 26 cents per message unless you want to send a picture then it goes
            up to 35 cents. Then there is visitation. some jails
            allow in-person visits but a lot of jails took that away during covid and have not brought it back. It
            is extremely difficult to not be able to see the person that you are in love with in person. Yes its good
            you can video visit but so much goes wrong.
            Some days the jail has issues with the internet and you miss it because they could not figure out how to get
            it to work. Other times I had it were the video never showed up and all that I could hear was audio. Also he
            was frozen one time and I waited a few minutes for it to fix but it did not so I had to close the visit and
            then reopen it just to see if it would fix the issue. All these things are worth it because of how much I love him
            but all these things are difficult to deal with.

        <h2 class="homeT">The Waiting Game</h2>
        <p class="homeT">&emsp;He is going to be in there for a while. So I am currently just trying to keep my mind
            busy. Working more at work, working more on the house when i am off. working out a lot more especially on days
            off. one problem I have is I like to eat my emotions so even when I work out more I am still gaining weight
            because of eating my emotions.
            However, I am also working on that and hoping to accomplish it very soon because I also have a weight loss
            goal that I would like to acheive before he gets out too. I know I can do this and our relationship will be
            unbreakable all I have to do is survive through the hardship. Things happen to make you stronger and I know
            this will make me stronger for sure. He is the love of my life and I will never give up. I cannot wait til he is 
            done and we are reunited once again.
